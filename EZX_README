To clean the generated files:
$make distclean

To regenerate config files and make:
$./configure --with-board=lubbock --with-cpu=pxa262 --with-linux-prefix=${HOME}/embedded/kernel/linux-2.4.17 --enable-usb
$make


The configure options:
1) board selection is lubbock, don't change it
2) kernel path, you can change it if you kernel path is another.
Additionally, you must add xscale_le-gcc compiler's path in path varible.

The image you build should be src/blob/blob

Note:
   Don't run automake, it will delete the configure and can't build for HAINAN product sucessfully.
