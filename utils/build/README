README for the "utils/build" directory

This directory contains two little scripts that allow developers to configure
and build blob for all supported architectures.

Usage:
- make a directory that will contain all build directories:
    mkdir ~/blob-build
- copy build_Makefile and build_all to that directory:
    cp build_Makefile ~/blob-build/Makefile
    cp build_all ~/blob-build/
- cd to the build directory:
    cd ~/blob-build/
- edit build_all and change linux_prefix and blob_src so they reflect your
  system
- run "./build_all" and watch how all architectures get automatically
  configured
- run "make" and all architectures are build
- run "make clean" to clean up all architectures

Note: the blob source directory should not be configured or otherwise this
trick won't work
