Release notes for blob-2.0.5-pre2
=================================

This is blob-2.0.5-pre2, a development snapshot. This is a work in
progress, so expect it to break on some parts. Don't complain that we
didn't warn you!

We admit, we made a mess of it. There's lots of work going on in blob
so we'd better release a development snapshot before we're going to
make it an even bigger mess. The documentation is still not in sync
with the code, but there is some new documentation in the doc/
directory. See the ChangeLog file to see what's new.

This snapshot is reported to work on:

- Assabet
- Assabet+Neponset
- LART
- Ipaq (only blob-chain)
- System3

It should work on:

- Badge4
- NESA
- PLEB
- Shannon (aka TuxScreen)
- Vercel UD-1 (IDR)
- Jornada 720

But was never tested on:

- Brutus
- CreditLART

If you meet any problems, don't hesitate to write to the LART mailing
list (see http://www.lart.tudelft.nl/list/), or join the #blob IRC
channel on irc.openprojects.net.




Release notes for blob-2.0.5-pre1
=================================

This is blob-2.0.5-pre1, a development snapshot. This is a work in
progress, so expect it to break on some parts. Don't complain that we
didn't warn you!

This version of blob is a major change from blob-2.0.4: lots of
cleanups, a couple of new features, and a lot easier to port to new
architectures. Note that the documentation is no longer in sync with
the code, we need to clean that up as well.

This snapshot is reported to work on:

- Assabet
- LART
- Ipaq (only blob-chain)
- Shannon (aka TuxScreen)
- System3
- Vercel UD-1 (IDR)

It should work on:

- NESA
- PLEB

But was never tested on:

- Brutus
- CreditLART

If you meet any problems, don't hesitate to write to the LART mailing
list (see http://www.lart.tudelft.nl/list/), or join the #blob IRC
channel on irc.openprojects.net.




Release notes for blob-2.0.4
============================

This is blob-2.0.4 a minor upgrade to blob-2.0.3 mainly meant as a
bugfix release.

What's new?
-----------

- Fix critical ramdisk size bug (size is in kilobytes, not in bytes).
  This should allow LARTs to boot with a ramdisk again.
- Fixed some include files.
- Documentation updates.
- Added some nice developer scripts in the utils directory.

Platform specific notes
-----------------------

See platform specific notes for blob-2.0.3




Release notes for blob-2.0.3
============================

This is blob-2.0.3, the successor to blob-1.0.8-pre2. There have been
a couple of other versions between 1.0.8-pre2 and 2.0.3, but those
were never "officially" released from the blob homepage:

- 2.0.0: never released snapshot that implemented run-from-ram but was
  never tested.
- 2.0.1: released by Wookey. basically a cleaned version of 2.0.0.
- 2.0.2: also released by Wookey. fixed a couple of bugs in 2.0.1.

To avoid confusion, we decided to name this release blob-2.0.3.


What's new?
-----------

- Support for NESA, SHANNON (aka TuxScreen), and CreditLART platforms
- Updates for PLEB
- Ability to write the flash (not on all platforms, read on)
- Lots of cleanups
- Automatic memory detection
- Kernel parameter passing
- Basic resume from suspend support (not yet tested, though)


Platform specific notes
-----------------------

Because we didn't test on any SA1110 platform, support for Assabet and
CreditLART are broken.

- Assabet: Broken.
- Brutus: Considered broken.
- CreditLART: Broken. Only initial support is in to test the hardware.
- LART: Fully supported.
- NESA: Fully supported.
- PLEB: Everything except writing to flash should work
- Shannon: Fully supported.
